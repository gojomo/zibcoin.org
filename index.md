# Introducing Ƶibcoin? 

*Zibcoin* is an alternate denominational unit for Bitcoin.

One Zibcoin is one-millionth of a Bitcoin. (Using metric/SI prefixes, a Zibcoin is synonymous with a "microbitcoin" or "µBTC". In the base units of Bitcoin, one Zibcoin is 100 Satoshis.)

That is:

<pre>
<b>  1          bitcoin</b> = 1,000,000    zibcoin = 100,000,000 satoshi
  0.000001   bitcoin =         <b>1    zibcoin</b> =         100 satoshi           
  0.00000001 bitcoin =         0.01 zibcoin =           <b>1 satoshi</b>
</pre>

# Why Ƶibcoin?

The Zibcoin unit allows the expression of common daily transactional costs - a meal, a ride, a bag of groceries – as whole countable numbers, now and for the foreseeable future, rather than as increasingly tiny decimal.

Unlike alternative names for the same unit, Zibcoin avoids triggering a layperson's confusion over the *milli-*/*micro-* difference, or how the prefix µ (greek *mu*) should be used or said.

Zibcoin remains usefully suggestive of 'Bitcoin', in form and sound, but is different enough to be easily distinguished on screen, in print, and by ear. 

Zibcoin avoids adding extra nerdy syllables (as with 'micro' or 'mu'/'eu') to the expression of everyday economic values. 

Truncated to 'zib', it even removes complexity for casual usage. 'Zib' works well as a noun…

> "I'll bring you a pizza for 10,000 zibs" 

…or even a verb…

> "when are you going to zib me 10,000 for that pizza Friday night?"

Using 'zib' avoids overloading existing English words like 'cent' or 'bit', each of which is already rife with contrasting meanings in the money and digital contexts. This minimizes risks of confusion during explanations and transactions. Since 'zib' is without a current meaning in English, it can acquire a unique and powerful meaning through this coinage and followup organic use. 

The Zibcoin unit lends itself to a single-character abbreviation, 'Z', that is used in relation to very few terrestrial currencies. 

There's also a currency-evocative Unicode character, *Ƶ*, the [Z with stroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_with_stroke). It's currently unused for any circulating terrestrial currency… but perhaps fittingly has been used in futuristic-fiction contexts. 

The currency code `XZB` appears available, if the community finds Zibcoin/XZB a better unit for facilitating currency exchange than the alternate emerging, informal code `XBT` for a full Bitcoin unit. (In this use, as with the others, Zibcoin units avoid deep-decimals.)

# Other Observations

By definition: 

      Ƶ1 = 1 ZBC = 1 µBTC = 0.000001 BTC = ฿0.000001
