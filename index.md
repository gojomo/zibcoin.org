# Introducing Ƶibcoin

*Zibcoin* is an alternate denominational unit for Bitcoin.

A Zibcoin is one-millionth of a Bitcoin. 

Zibcoin is synonymous with a "microbitcoin" ("µBTC" or sometimes "mics"/"mikes"). In the base 'Satoshi' units of Bitcoin, one Zibcoin is 100 Satoshis.

For reference:

<pre>
<b>  1          bitcoin</b> = 1,000,000    zibcoin = 100,000,000 satoshi
  0.000001   bitcoin =         <b>1    zibcoin</b> =         100 satoshi           
  0.00000001 bitcoin =         0.01 zibcoin =           <b>1 satoshi</b>
</pre>

## Why Zibcoin?

The Zibcoin unit makes common daily transactional amounts - the cost of a meal, a ride, a bag of groceries – into whole countable numbers, now and for the foreseeable future. In Bitcoin today, these values are awkwardly tiny fractional values, deep-decimals unfamiliar to consumers. (And with Bitcoin's continuing success, this problem will only get worse.) 

Unlike alternative names for the same unit, Zibcoin avoids triggering a layperson's confusion over the *milli-*/*micro-* difference, or how the prefix µ (greek *mu*) should be used or said.

Zibcoin remains usefully suggestive of 'Bitcoin', in form and sound, but is different enough to be easily distinguished on screen, in print, and by ear. 

Zibcoin avoids adding extra techie syllables (as with 'micro' or 'mu'/'eu') to the expression of everyday economic values. 

Truncated to 'zib', it even removes complexity for casual usage. 'Zib' works well as a noun…

> "I'll bring you a pizza for 10,000 zibs" 

…or even a verb…

> "when are you going to zib me 10,000 for that pizza Friday night?"

Using 'zib' avoids overloading existing English words like 'cent' or 'bit', each of which is already rife with contrasting meanings in the money and digital contexts. This minimizes risks of confusion during explanations and transactions. Since 'zib' has no current meaning in English, it can acquire a strong and unique meaning through this coinage and organic use. 

The Zibcoin unit lends itself to a single-character abbreviation, 'Z', that is used in relation to very few terrestrial currencies. 

There's also a currency-evocative Unicode character, *Ƶ*, the [Z with stroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_with_stroke). This character is currently unused for any circulating terrestrial currency… but perhaps fittingly *has* been used in futuristic-fiction contexts. 

The currency code `XZB` is available, and for the same reason of avoiding deep-decimal quotations, Zibcoin/`XZB` may be a better unit for standardizing currency exchange than the current emerging, informal Bitcoin code `XBT`. Still, siilar to the common use of 'BTC' to abbreviate Bitcoin, 'ZBC' is an effective casual abbreviation for Zibcoin.

Placing several popular notations and abbreviations together: 

      Ƶ1 = 1 ZBC = 1 µBTC = 0.000001 BTC = ฿0.000001
