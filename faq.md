# Ƶibcoin Frequently-Asked Questions

### Why not the "mic" (or "mike") as a casual way of referring to microbitcoins?

Of prior proposals, that's the best – but still has problems. 

It requires the secondary spelling ("mike") to clarify pronounciation. There will be a natural tendency to abbreviate it with an 'm' – which risks confusion with 'millis', a very different unit. Using the proper metric abbreviation, µ, just makes things seem more arcane.

It may invite the question, "Who's Mike? Is there a Michael Makamoto, perhaps Satoshi's long-lost son, brother, or father?"

Comparatively in the same contexts, 'zib' or 'Z' can be unambiguous. 

### What about the Bitcoin unit-abbreviation `XBT` gaining momentum as a currency-code?

Zibcoin may be a better unit for quoting currency exchange rates, by avoiding deep-decimal values, too.  If needed, the currency-code `XZB` appears to be available.
