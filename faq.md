# Ƶibcoin Frequently-Asked Questions

### Why not "mics" (pronounced "mikes") as a casual way of referring to microbitcoins?

Of prior proposals, that's the best – but still has problems. 

It requires the secondary spelling ("mike") to clarify pronounciation. There will be a natural tendency to abbreviate it with an 'm' – which risks confusion with 'millis', a very different unit. Using the proper metric abbreviation, µ ("mu"), then just makes things seem more arcane. Since it still references *micro-*, it still risks confusion with *milli-*, and still implies something that is tiny and perhaps invisible or ignorable. 

It may invite the questions, "Who's Mike? Is there a Mike Nakamoto, perhaps Satoshi's long-lost son, brother, or father?"

Comparatively, 'zib' or 'Z' can be unambiguously communicated, and used consistently across both formal software and casual conversation.

### What about the Bitcoin unit-abbreviation `XBT`, that's gaining momentum as a currency-code?

Zibcoin may be a better unit for quoting currency exchange rates, too, by avoiding deep-decimal values over certain expected quoting ranges. If needed, the currency-code `XZB` appears to be available.
